# Python packaging and Continuous Integration at DESC

This repository is designed to get you started developing Python packages and deploying Continuous Integration (CI) workflows at DESC.

Inside ``desc-continuous-integration`` there is some dummy code, a Python package called ``mydescpackage``, and a series of CI example workflows to go along with it, including how to deploy CI workflows to the *NERSC* machines.

#### Documentation
The accompanying documentation for this repository can be found [here](http://lsstdesc.org/desc-continuous-integration/).

#### The DESC CI Checklist
Those already familiar with *GitHub Actions* and CI can skip to the [DESC CI Checklist](http://lsstdesc.org/desc-continuous-integration/desc/ci/desc_checklist.html) to see our recommended strategy for CI workflows at DESC.
